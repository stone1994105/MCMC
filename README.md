# MCMC
In this project, we use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) technique to reproduce the "Hubble diagram for 42 high-redshift Type Ia supernovae from the Supernova Cosmology Project". The diagram is cited from this famous paper "Measurements of Ω and Λ from 42 high-redshift supernovae". The raw data can be found in the "p99-data.txt" file. 

For more details, see the "Project_2.ipynb" file.
